\section*{Biography}
I was born in a small village near Heidelberg in Germany and lived there until I moved to Fife in Scotland aged 6.
After finishing school at Madras College, St.\ Andrews I matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge in October 2006.
I graduated with a MEng in Chemical Engineering from the University of Cambridge in June 2010.
Afterwards I graduated I worked at the Materials Science Department as a graduate researcher investigating carbon capture fuel cell integration before setting off to travel  and work around Australia.
Having explored Australia for a year and a half, I decided to return to the UK to pursue a PhD investigating sustainable and renewable energy technologies. 

\section*{Motivation}
My motivation stems from a belief that sustainable use of global resources will manage to maintain the high standard of living 
	\footnote{The World Health Organisation reports the average life expectancy in the UK as 80 years, 83 in Switzerland and 79 years in the USA as of 2011 \cite{WHOstat2013}} 
experienced in much of the Western World, while preserving the natural world we live in. 
It is estimated that around half of all global forest cover has been lost; the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) cites deforestation, oil and gas development and climate change as threats to the natural environment and there is a measurable increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere \cite{Laurance2010, WWF, CO2trend}. 
I believe a move towards sustainable and carbon neutral energy generation will help ease the pressure that is currently placed on the world's resources thus limiting the environmental damage to the earth.
